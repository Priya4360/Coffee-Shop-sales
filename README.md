# Coffee-Shop-sales
## Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to analyze retail sales data from a coffee shop to gain actionable insights that will help improve business performance. By examining various aspects of sales data such as sales trends, peak hours, product performance, and sales variation across locations, we aim to provide recommendations that can boost sales and enhance operational efficiency.

## Key Business Questions
### How do sales vary by day of the week and hour of the day?

Analyzing sales data to understand which days and hours generate the most sales. This insight helps in optimizing staffing and inventory management.
### Are there any peak times for sales activity?

Identifying peak sales times during the day or week to determine high-traffic periods for better resource allocation.
### What is the total sales revenue for each month?

Tracking total monthly sales revenue to identify trends over time, enabling the coffee shop to plan promotions or special offers accordingly.
### How do sales vary across different store locations?

Analyzing sales performance by location to highlight top-performing stores and identify locations that may need operational or marketing improvements.
### What is the average price/order per person?

Calculating the average sales value per customer to assess spending patterns and inform pricing strategies or bundled offers.
### Which products are the best-selling in terms of quantity and revenue?

Identifying top-selling products both by quantity and revenue, allowing the coffee shop to focus on promoting or stocking popular items.
### How do sales vary by product category and type?

Categorizing products into different groups (e.g., beverages, snacks, bakery items) to examine sales performance by category and refine product offerings.
## Data Sources
### Sales Data: 
Includes transaction details such as product names, prices, sales quantities, timestamps, customer information, and store locations.
### Product Information:  
Data on product categories, types, and pricing.
### Store Location Data: 
Includes store identifiers and geographic information for each coffee shop location.
## Tools & Technologies
### Power BI: 
Used for creating visual dashboards to provide insights into sales trends, peak times, product performance, and location-based analysis.
### Excel/CSV: 
Source data will be in Excel or CSV format, which will be imported into Power BI for analysis.
## Data Cleaning and Preparation
### Data Preprocessing: 
Handling missing or incomplete data, standardizing date and time formats, and ensuring consistency in product names and store identifiers.
### Data Aggregation: 
Summarizing the sales data by different dimensions such as time (daily, weekly, monthly), product categories, and store locations.
## Analysis and Insights
### 1. Sales by Day and Hour:
A heatmap or bar chart will be used to visualize sales trends across different days and hours. This will highlight peak sales periods and low-traffic times.
### 2. Peak Sales Times:
Using line charts or time-series graphs, we will pinpoint the times of day or specific days of the week with the highest sales activity.
### 3. Monthly Sales Revenue:
A time-series graph showing total sales revenue for each month, allowing for the identification of seasonal trends or anomalies.
### 4. Location-Based Sales Analysis:
A comparison of sales performance across various store locations. A map visualization may also be used to depict geographic sales distribution.
### 5. Average Price per Order:
A calculation of the average order value per customer, which will be displayed using a KPI card or a simple metric visualization.
### 6. Best-Selling Products:
Bar charts or pie charts will be used to showcase the best-selling products in terms of both quantity and revenue, broken down by product type.
### 7. Product Category Sales:
A stacked bar chart or other visual breakdowns of sales by product categories such as beverages, bakery items, and snacks.
## Dashboard Features
### Interactive Filters: 
Allow users to filter sales by store location, date range, product category, or specific products.
### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): 
Display important metrics like total sales revenue, average sales per order, and monthly sales growth.
### Visualizations: 
Heatmaps, bar charts, line charts, pie charts, and map visuals to provide a comprehensive view of the sales data.
## Conclusion
This data analytics project will enable the coffee shop to make data-driven decisions that improve sales and operational performance. By identifying trends and optimizing resources, the business can increase efficiency and drive higher revenue.
